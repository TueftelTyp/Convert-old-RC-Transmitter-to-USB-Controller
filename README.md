# Convert old RC Transmitter to USB Controller
#### Converting an old RC Flight Transmitter to use it in Simulators
 
Do you have an old analogue RC radio transmitter at home and would like to use it in the simulator? That's exactly what happened to me, who wanted to make his father happy by breathing new life into the dusty Transmitter. 
Since I couldn't find a script that worked for me, in which everything really worked, i created this one. 

It now includes the use of 4 axes and up to 6 buttons/switches as standard. 
If your project requires more, I've left an analog input and 6 other digital inputs open.

 This sketch file is for use with Arduino Leonardo and Arduino Micro only. 
 And uses Joystick 1.0 library from Matthew Heironimus [ArduinoJoystickLibrary](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary/tree/version-1.0 "ArduinoJoystickLibrary")
 
 
*I will add the build process when my project is complete.*
